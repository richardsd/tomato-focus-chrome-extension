# Privacy Policy

Tomato Focus stores the minimum data needed to enable Jira syncing and your
settings. The extension does **not** transmit your Jira credentials anywhere
other than to Jira when you initiate a sync.

## Data Stored

The following Jira credentials are stored locally in your browser:

- Jira URL
- Jira username
- Jira API token

## Where Data Is Stored

All Jira credentials are stored in Chrome's local extension storage via
`chrome.storage.local` on your device.

## How to Remove Your Data

You can remove Jira credentials at any time by:

1. Opening the extension settings (popup or dashboard).
2. Clearing the Jira URL, username, and token fields.
3. Saving your settings.

To remove **all** stored extension data, uninstall the extension from
`chrome://extensions/`.
